<a id="1-injection" name="1-injection"></a>
## 1. Injection

> Injection flaws occur when untrusted input is interpreted as commands, expressions, or queries.

**Applicability & Mitigations:**  
This is a pure client-side application; there is no backend interpreting user input as code or queries. All user-provided data stays in the browser unless explicitly exported.

---

<a id="2-broken-authentication" name="2-broken-authentication"></a>
## 2. Broken Authentication

> Flaws in authentication/session management.

**Applicability:**  
The application has no authentication; this risk does not apply internally.

---

<a id="3-sensitive-data-exposure" name="3-sensitive-data-exposure"></a>
## 3. Sensitive Data Exposure

> Improper protection of sensitive data in transit or at rest.

**Considerations:**  
- The app processes data in a state using the `Zustand` library, exported JSON is under user control
- If the app is hosted, the hosting endpoint should be served over HTTPS to prevent tampering of the application code in transit

<a id="4-xml-external-entities-xxe" name="4-xml-external-entities-xxe"></a>
## 4. XML External Entities (XXE)

> Risks from unsafe XML processing.

**Applicability:**  
This risk does not apply, as sec-o-simple does no XML processing.

---

<a id="5-broken-access-control" name="5-broken-access-control"></a>
## 5. Broken Access Control

> Improper enforcement of permissions.

**Applicability:**  
As sec-o-simple does not require any authentication and access control, this risk does not apply. See also: [Broken Authentication](#2-broken-authentication).

---

<a id="6-security-misconfiguration" name="6-security-misconfiguration"></a>
## 6. Security Misconfiguration

> Insecure defaults or incomplete setup.

**Mitigations / Recommendations:**  
- Host the static assets (HTML/JS/CSS) from a trusted origin; use HTTPS with proper headers
- Configure CSP (Content Security Policy) headers at the hosting layer to limit injection of external scripts/styles if embedding in a site.  
- Disable overly verbose error reporting in production builds; errors shown to users should be generic and not expose internal implementation details
- Ensure the build pipeline (e.g., Vite) is not serving development artifacts publicly in production.

---

<a id="7-cross-site-scripting-xss" name="7-cross-site-scripting-xss"></a>
## 7. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

> Execution of untrusted scripts in the browser.

**Mitigations:**  
- The app is built with React, which auto-escapes interpolated data.
- Recommend deploying with a restrictive CSP to mitigate injection from any compromised third-party inclusions.

---

<a id="8-insecure-deserialization" name="8-insecure-deserialization"></a>
## 8. Insecure Deserialization

> Processing untrusted serialized data leading to logic compromise.

**Applicability & Mitigations:**  
- The application consumes JSON provided by the user (e.g., file upload). All input is validated using the installed csaf-validator-lib

---

<a id="9-using-components-with-known-vulnerabilities" name="9-using-components-with-known-vulnerabilities"></a>
## 9. Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities

> Outdated or vulnerable third-party components can compromise the application.

**Mitigations:**  
- Commit and track the lockfile (`package-lock.json` or equivalent) to ensure reproducible dependency resolution.  
- Dependabot is used for automatic update notifications
- Review any third-party widgets or plugins before inclusion; limit external script loading to trusted sources

---

<a id="10-insufficient-logging--monitoring" name="10-insufficient-logging--monitoring"></a>
## 10. Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

> Lack of visibility into abnormal behavior.

**Applicability:**  
- Being client-only, there is no centralized logging. The application should:  
  - Fail gracefully and show user-friendly error messages without leaking internal data
  - Optionally expose a debug mode (disabled in production) for local troubleshooting
